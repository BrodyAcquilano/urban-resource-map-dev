# Urban Resource Map

A full-stack web app for mapping urban resources like water fountains, food banks, libraries, and more.

Built with:

- React + Vite (frontend)
- Express + MongoDB (backend)
- Leaflet for interactive maps

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies** by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root folder with your MongoDB connection string:

   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<yourUser>:<yourPassword>@yourcluster.mongodb.net/
   ```

   > 🔐 Do not commit your `.env` file — it is ignored by `.gitignore`.

4. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

The project includes both a frontend and a backend. When you run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

It will:

- Start the **backend API server** on http://localhost:3000
- Start the **frontend app** on http://localhost:5173

You can then interact with the API from your frontend (e.g., fetching or posting location data).

---

## 🧩 Development Proxy (Vite → Express)

During development, Vite is configured to proxy API requests to the backend server.

This allows you to use relative paths in your frontend code like:

```js
fetch("/api/locations");
```

instead of hardcoding:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/locations");
```

## 🧠 App Structure & Routing

The `App.jsx` file serves as the root of the application. It contains:

- Global UI components like the **Header**, **MapPanel**, and **FilterPanel**
- Route definitions for three main pages:
  - `/` → **Home Page**: View nearby resources
  - `/editor` → **Editor Page**: Add, edit, or delete location data
  - `/export` → **Export Page**: Generate and export maps as PDFs

These pages share global state (markers, filters, etc.) to avoid redundant reloads. Changing pages doesn’t reset filters or trigger new fetches unless needed.

---

## 🧩 Data Model Overview

The app’s dynamic behavior is driven by a centralized **data model** in `dataModel.js`, which defines:

- The **categories** of information (e.g. resources, services, comforts)
- The **default structure** of location objects (e.g. open hours, booleans, arrays)
- Shared constants (e.g. days of the week, label sets, validation helpers)

This file powers:

- ✅ UI rendering (checkboxes, labels, filters)
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Default state generation
- ✅ Output display logic (info panels, exports)
- ✅ Filter logic for map markers

By modifying the data model, developers can:

- Add new fields or categories (e.g., “First Aid” or “Charging Station”)
- Track seasonal or time-based exceptions
- Control which filters are shown
- Repurpose the app for other domains (e.g. medical clinics, public restrooms, climate shelters)

Changes to the label lists (like `resources` or `services`) automatically affect all relevant forms, filters, and displays — no manual updates needed across components.

---

## 🧭 Workflows and Use Cases

The app is structured around three key workflows:

### 🗺 Viewing Controls (Home Page)

Find free resources based on user-selected filters — without needing to search for businesses by name or category. This allows:

- Comparing services that match personal needs (rather than ads)
- Identifying high-resource zones (e.g. green for well-served areas, red for deserts)
- Overlaying transit or mobility routes between locations
- Adding seasonal or hourly resource awareness (e.g. warming centre in winter only)

### ✏️ Data Management (Editor Page)

Edit resource data manually or crowdsource input. Possible configurations:

- Open access (default)
- Admin-restricted access (via login logic, not yet implemented)
- Add, edit, or delete locations dynamically with live updates to the map

### 🖨 Export Tools (Export Page)

Generate PDF maps with filtered results for offline use or sharing with:

- Outreach teams
- People without phones or reliable connectivity
- Printed handouts for service providers

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- ✅ Add scoring logic to highlight strong/weak areas
- ✅ Add seasonal/time filters to track shifting availability
- ✅ Add user login or role-based permissions for editing
- ✅ Export full-page PDFs with custom map overlays
- ✅ Add import/export buttons for bulk JSON or CSV data

---

## 🌍 Use Cases

This app can be customized for:

- 🏙 City planning & public policy
- 🚶 Homeless outreach & mobile resource guides
- 🚲 Bicycle route + amenity mapping
- 🧭 Disaster response & emergency coordination
- 🌡 Heat/cold wave survival mapping
- 🧘‍♀️ Community wellness directories

Its modular data structure allows the same core system to support new applications by simply changing the data model and UI copy.

## 🌍 Beyond Emergency Services — What This Platform Can Become

The Urban Resource Map is currently focused on mapping free or essential urban services like water fountains, food banks, and shelters. But underneath that is a **powerful, reusable map-based data management system**.

It’s not just a viewer — it’s a full **map management terminal** and **data management interface**, designed to let users:

- Load and visualize structured location-based data from a database
- Apply filters to explore patterns, analyze gaps, or generate insights
- Modify data by editing, adding, or removing markers through the UI
- Export maps and data summaries for offline use, print, or reporting

Because the platform is modular, filter-driven, and uses a shared data model, it can be **reused for entirely different industries** with only minor tweaks — or made configurable for multiple audiences.

---

## 🔄 Why It's Powerful

✅ **Custom Filters**  
Use hardcoded or user-generated filters to sort markers by category, time, score, season, accessibility, etc.

✅ **Database-Linked**  
Pull live data from MongoDB (or any other backend), update it with the UI, and reflect it instantly on the map.

✅ **Visual-First Editing**  
Modify datasets spatially — see what’s near a river, highway, or outside a city radius and edit/remove with no need for complex calculations.

✅ **Data Control Terminal**  
This app is not just a viewer — it lets admins or analysts interact with spatial data directly through a single unified interface.

---

## 🧠 General Use Cases

### 1. **Map Management**

- Visualize all markers by category, type, or zone
- Highlight problem areas (e.g., resource deserts or high-risk zones)
- Plan spatial relationships (e.g., buffer zones, coverage gaps)

### 2. **Data Management**

- Use the editor to add, modify, or delete entries in real time
- Sync changes with a backend database (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase, SQL)
- Validate data visually before committing it (e.g., "is this factory too close to a residential zone?")

### 3. **Resource Management**

- Monitor and track the distribution of public resources
- Score locations by quality, access, or timeliness
- Generate printable reports showing gaps or redundancies

### 4. **Analytical Insight**

- Apply layered filters to detect trends (e.g., "Which parks are accessible year-round AND within 10km of transit?")
- Enable statistical overlay (heatmaps, zone scoring, corridor detection)
- Use data export to generate reports for policy or research

## ⚡ Rapid Pinning Mode (Symbol-Only Marker Inventory)

### 🧠 Concept

Allow users to select a marker type from a toolbar (e.g., Water Fountain, Bench, Wi-Fi Spot) and then click on the map to drop a symbol — no form, no modal, no data entry.

Each marker would store:

- `type`: (e.g., "Fountain", "Bench", "Charging Station")
- `lat`, `lng`: (auto-generated on click)
- `id`: (auto-generated or Mongo `_id`)
- Possibly: `timestamp` or `userId` (if tracking contributions)

This simplifies UX and **dramatically increases speed** of data collection or surveying.

---

### 🛠️ Integration Ideas

- 🔘 Add a toggle button in the UI: “Rapid Pin Mode”
- 🧭 Show a horizontal toolbar of icons/types across the top or side (like drawing tools in design software)
- 🖱️ User clicks a type → map enters “add mode” → clicking the map adds that symbol
- ✏️ Optional: allow user to drag-to-reposition or right-click to remove

---

### 🧩 Data Model (Minimalist Version)

---

{
id: "uuid-123",
type: "Water Fountain",
latitude: 43.12345,
longitude: -80.12345
}

### 🔎 Filter/Display Logic

- Only filter by `type`
- Use custom icons or symbols for each marker type
- Possibly add clustering or grouping if many pins exist in one area

---

### 🧰 Use Cases

| Context                  | Example Application                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔌 Infrastructure Survey | Map all visible electrical boxes or manhole covers     |
| 💧 Public Services       | Rapidly log every water fountain or hydrant            |
| 🚮 Urban Cleanups        | Drop pins for overflowing trash bins or graffiti spots |
| 🌳 Forestry / Parks      | Log tree types, stumps, or damage during fieldwork     |
| 📡 Signal Mapping        | Mark weak Wi-Fi zones or dead mobile signal spots      |
| 🛠️ Field Repair Logs     | Workers drop markers for potholes, leaks, etc.         |
| 🧭 Trail Management      | Pin benches, signs, campsites, hazards                 |
| 🚶‍♂️ Accessibility Audit   | Drop pins for curb cuts, stairs, elevators, etc.       |

---

### 💡 Bonus Extensions

- Allow exporting all pins to CSV, GeoJSON, or PDF
- Enable pin color coding by type
- Add simple “notes” field (optional popover or right-click edit)
- Add undo/redo for rapid workflows
- Later: allow offline use for mobile field teams

---

### 🧠 Summary

**Rapid Pin Mode turns your app into a spatial sketchpad.**
It’s the fastest way to populate a map with real-world data when all you need is a type and a location.

It’s also a great demo of how the same platform can serve:

- Urban planners
- Public service agencies
- Field researchers
- Environmental groups
- Internal asset tracking

All without writing a line of new backend code — just by adjusting your frontend workflow and using your existing map + marker infrastructure.
